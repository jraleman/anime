# Anime

This project uses MyAnimeList.net account to fetch the user preferences of anime and display it in a nice chart or something like that. I use this as my first date ice-breaker 

## Usecase

This project can be used in multiple and endless situations, one of them can be:

> On your first date with a person, they ask you what are you into... and the topic of Anime comes out. Then, your date asks you if you watch anime, and you answer back; "I am glad you asked, let me show you..."

And you show your date this project. You win.
